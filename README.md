# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

Hi! My name is Joey (She/Her) and I enjoy FPS and rhythm games. I mostly play VALORANT, but go through phases of Minecraft, GTA, and Fortnite with my friends. I grew up playing ROBLOX since I was 6 years old (I was an iPad kid) and then Rainbow 6 Siege, and finally Valorant. I don't have any experience with game development, I tried to learn how to script in ROBLOX but I was like 9 and couldn't be bothered to watch a 20 minute introduction video. My main focus is on graphic design and UI/UX design. I made models in ROBLOX studio and really wanted to be some kind of architect or set builder when I was younger, but I realized I'm not too cut out to be an engineer for the physical world. Many people mentioned rhythm games today and I thought it'd be interesting to make a rhythm game similar to osu!mania, RoBeats! on ROBLOX or Fortnite Festival because those are my favorite types of rhythm games. Another idea was sparked by my friend is a mixture of RUST and Unturned or like any PvE zombie game in which it's a multiplayer map where you can raid and interact with other players and their bases, but you also fight zombies (obviously not thought out and nuanced yet). But for starters, I want to create simple, "mindless," puzzle games like those you see in corny mobile ads.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [ ] Game Design & Interactive Media

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?

Basic coding/programming knowledge at the very least and something to put in my amateur portfolio of games. From your introduction to the class, I feel very relieved, but still stressed because I don't have any experience in coding even if you say we aren't expected to have any.

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?

How well I will consume and learn the material. I know I can participate and show up for class, but I'm worried that learning coding language just won't click.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)

0

2. Game development (any engine)

0

3. Unity

0

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document

A file for game design?

2. Scope management

Something to do with audience? Who or where you expect your game to reach?

3. Iteration

Something to do with coding language like the text and typing.

4. Object-Oriented programming

Being objective and task-driven when coding something.

5. Model-View-Controller architecture

Designing/developing something that works with the subject (model), aesthetic or camera view, and the player?
